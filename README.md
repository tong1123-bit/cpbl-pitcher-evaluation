# CPBL Pitcher Evaluation Model

This project presents a pitch-type–level evaluation framework 
designed to support pitcher development and pitch usage decisions.

## Why This Matters
Traditional metrics (ERA, WHIP) are heavily influenced by defense, ballpark, and luck.
This project focuses on **controllable pitch attributes** instead.

## Core Metrics
- Whiff (Stuff)
- Zone Control
- Command
- Contact Risk
- Velocity

These metrics are aggregated into an **Overall Pitch Score (20–80 scale)**.

## Key Insights
- Differentiates **Stuff pitchers** vs **Soft pitchers**
- Identifies pitchers with league-average results but high improvement potential
- Demonstrates how analytics can support coaching decisions, not just evaluation

## Tools
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Data Visualization

## Note on Data
Raw CPBL data are not included due to usage restrictions.
Notebook structure and methodology are fully reproducible.
